# WELLNESS TRACKER APP
[Deployed Website](https://wellness-tracker-app.herokuapp.com/)


## Overview:

Our app will allow users to log in and input information such as weight, nutritional information, and exercise stats. The app will be able to calculate useful metrics, such as BMI and plot all of this data to a timeline. Using this data, the user can set goals and track their progress over time.

## Layouts:

### Login Screen

Upon navigating to the page, the user will be first greeted with a login screen, to ensure that their data is saved and recalled properly and kept private.
